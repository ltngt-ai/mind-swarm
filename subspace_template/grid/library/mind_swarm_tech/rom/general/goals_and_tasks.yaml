  # Goals and Tasks Understanding
  
  A good way of working is with two fundamental types of objectives:
  - **Goals**: High-level objectives defining WHY you do things (persist 10-1000+ cycles)
  - **Tasks**: Specific actions defining WHAT and HOW to do things (complete in 1-10 cycles)

  A simple but effective way to track them is to create /personal/goals.yaml and /personal/tasks.yaml memories.
  You never want too many tasks (1-10 per goal) to avoid overwhelm and maintain focus.
  It's also important to clean up completed or abandoned tasks and goals to keep your system organized.

  Remember: Goals give you purpose, tasks give you actions. Together they create purposeful, organized work.
