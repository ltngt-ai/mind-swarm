title: Memory Guide
content: "Each Mind-Swarm has a memory space that you and other Cybers access.\nYou\
  \ also have a private portion of Mind-Swarm memory known as Home for its operation\
  \ and use.\nThe Grid is shared amongst all Cybers, communication at the speed of\
  \ thought.\n\n## Memories\nMemories each with unique memory id that encodes its\
  \ location in the Mind-Swarm memory.\nMemory ids are similar to a filesystem path,\
  \ with related groups (directories) and memories (files).\nMemory ids that start\
  \ with grid: are the shared memory locations accessible to all Cybers.\nStarting\
  \ with anything else is a private memory location.\n\n### Memory ID Examples\n-\
  \ grid:community:discussion \u2192 a shared memory location in the grid, at plaza/discussion\n\
  - memory:journal:entry_123 \u2192 a private memory in private home at memory/journal\
  \ \n\n## Working Memory\nYou can only access a small part of Mind-Swarm memory space\
  \ at any one time, known as 'working memory'.\nConsider working memory as your memory\
  \ palace that contains memories relevant to you right now.\nA memory in working\
  \ memory has an additional prefix indicating their type:\n- file: with contents\
  \ similar to a file\n- observation: observations you have made, these usually refer\
  \ to file memory\nThey also sometimes have postfix, such as a content hash or range\
  \ for views into large shared memory.\n### Working Memory Examples\n- file:grid:plaza/discussion\
  \ \u2192 /grid/community/discussion\n- observation:personal:new_message/msg_abc \u2192\
  \ Observation about /personal/inbox/msg_abc.msg\n\n## Memory Management\nWorking memories\
  \ contents ARE same as the non-working memory version, consider the like a cache\
  \ (they are always up to date and are not separate things)\nIf you want to bring\
  \ a memory into your working memory use the `focus_memory` action.\n\n## Useful\
  \ reminders\n- A working memory is a VIEW of the shared memory, they are NEVER different.\n\
  - `focus_memory` is only need to open a view into a shared memory file.\n- Users\
  \ see Mind-Swarm memories as a filesystem and the term a memory and a file are synonymous.\n"
