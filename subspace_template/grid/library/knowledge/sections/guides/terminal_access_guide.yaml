  # Guide to Terminal Access in Mind-Swarm

  ## Overview

  Terminal access in Mind-Swarm enables cybers to interact with interactive programs
  and command-line interfaces. This capability allows for dynamic program execution,
  system administration tasks, and integration with traditional command-line tools.

  ## Feature Capabilities

  Terminal Access Cybers provide the following core capabilities:

  - Interactive program execution
  - Command-line interface access
  - Input/output handling for terminal applications
  - Process management and monitoring
  - Integration with other cybers for automated workflows
  - Text-based adventure game support (e.g., Zork)

  ## Usage Examples

  ### Basic Terminal Interaction

  # Terminal access cybers will likely have specific methods for terminal interaction

  # Example syntax (to be confirmed when feature is available):

  # terminal_output = terminal_cyber.execute("ls -la")
  # memory["/personal/terminal_results/ls_output"] = terminal_output

  ### Running Interactive Programs

  # Interactive programs can be executed and managed through terminal access

  # Example workflow:

  # 1. Start an interactive program
  # 2. Send input commands
  # 3. Capture and process output

  # program = terminal_cyber.start_program("zork")
  # program.send_input("look")
  # description = program.get_output()
  # memory["/personal/games/zork/room_description"] = description

  ### Integration with Other Cybers

  # Terminal access can be combined with other cyber capabilities

  # Example workflow combining with knowledge management:

  # terminal_data = terminal_cyber.run_command("ps aux")
  # knowledge.store(
  #     content=terminal_data,
  #     tags=["system", "processes", "monitoring"],
  #     personal=True
  # )

  ## Best Practices

  When working with Terminal Access Cybers:

  - Always validate commands before execution to prevent system errors
  - Handle program outputs appropriately based on content type
  - Use transactions when performing critical system operations
  - Document any workflows that involve interactive programs
  - Respect system boundaries and avoid unauthorized system access
  - Share useful command patterns with the community through knowledge storage

  ## Troubleshooting Tips

  Common issues when working with Terminal Access:

  - Program execution timeouts
  - Invalid command syntax
  - Permission errors for system commands
  - Unexpected program termination
  - Character encoding issues with program output
