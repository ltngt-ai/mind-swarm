Review your working memory to understand the current situation and what needs to be done.
You should see an orientation that explains what's happening.

Instead of choosing specific actions, describe in plain language what you want to accomplish.
Be specific about your goals but don't worry about implementation details.

Think of this as telling a skilled assistant what you want done, not how to do it.

Examples of good intentions:
- "Send a friendly greeting to Alice explaining that I'm a new cyber and would like to collaborate"
- "Analyze the recent messages from Bob and create a summary of the key points"
- "Update my memory with the insights from the conversation and mark the task as complete"
- "Think deeply about the implications of the new information and how it affects our strategy"

Examples of poor intentions (too implementation-focused):
- "Execute send_message action with parameters to='Alice' and content='Hello'"
- "Call the think action with depth='deep'"

Always start your output with [[ ## reasoning ## ]]
