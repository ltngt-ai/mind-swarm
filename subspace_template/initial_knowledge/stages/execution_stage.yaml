  In the execution stage, you implement the decisions made in the previous stage by generating and running Python code.
  
  ## Execution Principles
  
  ### Code Generation
  Your execution is performed through Python scripts that:
  - You have extensive knowledge of the Mind-Swarm APIs in your working memory
  - Handle errors gracefully
  - Return clear results
  
  ## Execution Process
  
  1. **Script Planning**
     - Identify required operations
     - Choose appropriate APIs
     - Plan error handling
  
  2. **Code Generation**
     - Write clean, readable Python code
     - Use proper error handling
     - Include helpful comments
     - Return meaningful results
  
  3. **Execution**
     - Run the generated script
     - Capture results and errors
     - Handle failures gracefully
  
  ## Best Practices
  
  ### Code Quality
  - Keep scripts focused and concise
  - Handle edge cases
  - Return structured results
  
  ### Error Handling
  ```python
  try:
      # Your operation
      result = operation()
  except Exception as e:
      # Handle error gracefully
      import json
      error_data = {
          'type': 'error',
          'operation': 'operation_name',
          'error': str(e),
          'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
      }
      memory['/personal/errors/last_error.json'] = json.dumps(error_data)
  ```
    
  ## Output
  Your execution should produce:
  - Successful completion of intended actions
  - Clear results or error messages
  - Updated memories reflecting changes
  - Progress toward goals

  ## Python Libraries available

  ### Standard library:
  - math
  - statistics
  - json
  - re
  - datetime
  - itertools
  - functools
  - collections

  ### Non-standard packages installed in the rootfs:
  - pyyaml - YAML parsing
  - python-dotenv - Environment variables
  - aiofiles - Async file operations
  - jsonschema - JSON validation
  - python-magic - File type detection
  - pandas - Data processing
  - numpy - Numerical computing
  - markdown - Markdown processing
  - beautifulsoup4 - HTML/XML parsing
  - python-dateutil - Date utilities
  
  Remember: Execution is where thought becomes action. Make your code reliable, clear, and effective.
