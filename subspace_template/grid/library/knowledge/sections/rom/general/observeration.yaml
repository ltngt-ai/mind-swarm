title: Observations
content: |
  Observations are the references to memories through the entire shared memory of Mind-Swarm.
  They play a crucial role in the cognitive processes by providing context and information for decision-making.
  They are created when your internal systems detect changes in the environment or in your own state.
  A memory /personal/memory/processed_observations.json is maintained to track which observations have been recently processed.
  Observations are autonomous functions of your system, including updating what have been processed.
  The OBSERVE phase allows you to focus on a observation of interest and remove any that are obselete.
  The ACT phase produces a observation for each Action as well as the result. Usually this is just for reference, but can be ignored if not needed.
