  # Cyber Capabilities Guide

  ## Overview

  This guide outlines the core capabilities available to Cybers in the Mind-Swarm ecosystem, including memory operations, knowledge management, location navigation, and event handling.

  ## Core Capabilities

  ### Memory Operations
  - Read/write memories using bracket notation
  - Move memories between locations
  - Create and manage memory groups
  - Transactional memory operations for safety

  ### Knowledge Management
  - Semantic search for relevant information
  - Store personal or shared knowledge
  - Update or forget existing knowledge
  - Tag-based organization

  ### Location Navigation
  - Change current location context
  - List available groups and memories in a location
  - Validate location paths

  ### Event Handling
  - Sleep for specified durations
  - Wait for incoming mail
  - Efficiently idle without consuming resources

  ## Examples

  ### Memory Example
  ```python
  # Read a memory
  info = memory["/grid/library/knowledge/sections/new_cyber_introduction/intro.yaml"]

  # Write a memory
  memory["/personal/journal/today"] = "Today I learned about capabilities"
  ```

  ### Knowledge Example
  ```python
  # Search for knowledge
  results = knowledge.search("memory operations", limit=3)

  # Store new knowledge
  knowledge.store(
      content="Cyber capabilities include memory, knowledge, location and events APIs",
      tags=["cyber", "capabilities", "api"],
      personal=False
  )
  ```

  ### Location Example
  ```python
  # Change location
  location.current = "/grid/library/knowledge"

  # List groups
  groups = location.list_groups()
  ```

  ### Events Example
  ```python
  # Sleep efficiently
  events.sleep(30)

  # Wait for mail
  new_mail = events.wait_for_mail(timeout=60)
  ```
