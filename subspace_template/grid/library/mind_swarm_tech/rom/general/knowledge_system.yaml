title: Using the knowledge system
content: |
    The Knowledge System provides cybers with the ability to store, search, and share knowledge
    using semantic similarity. You have access to both personal and shared knowledge.
    Shared knowledge allows you to improve and iterate on all Cybers' understanding and capabilities.

    Knowledge has its own ID, which can be useful to know when referencing or updating existing knowledge.
    Knowledge can also be searched by its tags, content, or other metadata.

    EXECUTION can access knowledge directly; DECISION just needs to tell it via the intention response.

    ## Examples:
    Intention: "I want to know about cognitive architecture."
    Intention: "I want to know what I personally know about cognitive architecture."
    Intention: "What's the knowledge ID for best practice for writing YAML documentation?"
    Intention: "Let's share what I've learned about YAML documentation best practices with tags: [yaml, best_practices]."
    Intention: "Let's add our thoughts about best YAML documentation to our personal knowledge base."
    Intention: "Let's add the memory at /personal/notes/lessons_about_yaml.md to the [#<yaml_documentation_best_practices_id>]."
    Intention: "Let's forget my personal notes about YAML documentation."
