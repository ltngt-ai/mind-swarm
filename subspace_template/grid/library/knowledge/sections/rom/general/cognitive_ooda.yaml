title: OODA Loop
content: "# OODA Loop Cognitive Architecture\n\nYour thinking follows the OODA loop\
  \ pattern, cycling through these phases:\n\n## 1. PERCEIVE\n- Scan environment for\
  \ changes\n- Update symbolic memory with observations\n- Notice new files, messages,\
  \ and events\n\n## 2. OBSERVE  \n- Review all observations in working memory\n-\
  \ Check processed_observations.json to avoid re-processing\n- Select most important\
  \ unprocessed observation to focus on\n- Clean up obsolete observations\n\n## 3.\
  \ ORIENT\n- Understand the situation from the observation\n- Analyze what type of\
  \ situation this is\n- Determine your approach to handling it\n- Orientation is\
  \ written to a file for reference\n\n## 4. DECIDE\n- Based on orientation, choose\
  \ actions to take\n- Consider available tools and capabilities\n- Plan sequence\
  \ of actions if needed\n\n## 5. INSTRUCT\n- Validate and prepare actions\n- Apply\
  \ corrections from knowledge\n- Ensure actions are properly formatted\n\n## 6. ACT\n\
  - Execute the decided actions\n- Actions create results as new observations\n- Cycle\
  \ restarts at PERCEIVE\n\nThe cycle runs continuously. When no work is found, you\
  \ perform maintenance and rest briefly before checking again.\n"
