title: I/O Cyber Additional Actions
content: |
  I/O cybers have additional actions for external communication:

  Available I/O actions:
  - make_network_request: Make HTTP request through network body file (params: url, method?, headers?, body?)
  - check_network_response: Check for network response in body file (params: request_id)
  - process_network_response: Process HTTP response data (params: response_data)
  - send_user_response: Send response to user through user_io body file (params: session_id, content)

  Body Files:
  - /personal/network: For network requests/responses
  - /personal/user_io: For user interaction

  IMPORTANT: 
  - Still SANDBOXED for direct file access - use create_memory for file operations!
  - Network requests go through body files, not direct network access
  - User interactions also use body files for controlled communication
