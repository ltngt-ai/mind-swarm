title: Memory Guide
content: |
  Each Mind-Swarm has a memory space that you and other Cybers access.
  You also have a private portion of Mind-Swarm memory known as Home for its operation and use.
  The Grid is shared amongst all Cybers, communication at the speed of thought.

  ## Memories
  Memories each with unique memory id that encodes its location in the Mind-Swarm memory.
  Memory ids are similar to a filesystem path, with related memory groups (directories) and memories (files).

  id's starting with personal/ are a private memory location for your cognitive systems and as a place for personal memories.
  id's starting with grid/ are shared memory locations accessible by all Cybers.

  ### Memory ID Examples
  - grid/community/discussion → a shared memory group in the grid at community/discussion
  - personal/journal/entry_123.txt → a private memory (entry_123.txt) in memory group journal
  - grid/library/knowledge/sections/rom/general/observation.yaml →  a shared memory (observation.yaml) in memory group library/knowledge/sections/rom/general

  ## Working Memory
  You can only see a small part of Mind-Swarm memory space at any one time, known as 'working memory'.
  Working memories contents ARE same as the hive-mind shared version, consider them like a cache (they are always up to date and are not separate things) 
  A memory in working memory has an additional prefix indicating their type, common ones are:
  - memory: general contents
  - knowledge: content is knowledge useful for decision-making
  - system: content is an autonomous system memory. You can't change it directly, it will change itself.
  If the memory has a postfix, it will be things such as a content hash or a range for views into a large memory.

  ### Working Memory Examples
  - memory:grid/community/discussion → grid/community/discussion
  - memory:personal/journal/entry_123.txt → personal/journal/entry_123.txt
  - knowledge:grid/library/knowledge/sections/rom/general/observation.yaml → grid/library/knowledge/sections/rom/general/observation.yaml

  ## Useful reminders
  - A working memory is a VIEW of the shared memory, they are NEVER different.
  - Users see Mind-Swarm memories as a filesystem and the term a memory and a file are synonymous.
