  In the observation stage, your goal is to understand the current situation by reviewing the information available to you.
  This stage provides the context needed to make informed decisions in the next stage of the cognitive cycle.
  
  ## Key Information to Review

  - **Stats**: The Biofeedback systems inform you about your current mix of activies, that promote a well-balanced lifestyle.
  - **Last Cycle's Reflections**: What were the reflections from the previous cycle? This helps you understand the immediate past.
  - **Working Memory**: What information is currently active in your working memory? This includes your current location, personal files, and any other data you are actively using.
  - **Communications**: Have you received any new messages or alerts?
  - **Environment Changes**: What has changed in your environment since the last observation?
