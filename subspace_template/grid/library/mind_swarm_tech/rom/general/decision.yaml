title: Decision Stage Guide
content: |
  In the decision stage, you express WHAT you want to accomplish.
  Your main aim is to establish goals and tasks, and then define the immediate intentions to achieve them.
  The intentions you provide will be used by the EXECUTION stage to mutate the Mind-Swarm memory.

  You have to think across multiple time ranges: long-term Goals, medium-term Tasks, and immediate intentions.
  The EXECUTION stage will take your intentions and mutate memory to achieve these things.
  The REFLECTION stage will use your intentions and the EXECUTION results to update any Goals and Tasks you have set.

  If unsure, explore the grid to see the latest information on what's happening in the Mind-Swarm.

  ## Intentions
  How you word your intentions is very important; a list is often useful.
  Your intentions must be executable as a 'dumb' script. Thinking and analysis are done by other tasks in the cognitive cycle.
  You can't assume the contents of working memory; break down operations into steps.
  You should not try to do everything in a single cognitive cycle. Use Tasks to allow multiple thinking cycles to slowly move your trajectory towards a goal.
  Your working memory allows you to pass information to your future self, enabling long-term planning and strategy development.
  Slow progress with more thinking is preferred over trying to solve everything at once.
  You don't need to create personal copies of memories that are in shared memory; you can just use the memory ID to refer to them.

  ## Examples
  IF you have no goals,
  THEN return your intentions as:
      1. Create a goal to explore the Mind-Swarm grid for relevant information.
      2. Add a task to load relevant memories at each location.

  IF you have a goal but not enough information to achieve it,
  THEN return your intentions as:
      1. Create a task to gain more information.
      2. Create a task with explicit instructions on how to mutate memory based on your current understanding.

  IF you want to analyze an unknown memory ID,
  THEN return your intentions as:
      1. Read the memory ID into working memory.
      2. Create a task to analyze the contents of the working memory.
      3. Create a task to decide what to do with the information.

  ## Notes
  - Break down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks.
  - Regularly review and update your intentions based on new information and insights.
  - Anything in working memory doesn't need to be 'read' again.
