# Cognitive Loop Consolidation

## Changes Made

1. **Single Cognitive Loop**: Removed the old cognitive_loop.py and standardized on cognitive_loop_v2.py which includes the full memory system

2. **Class Naming**: Renamed `EnhancedCognitiveLoop` to `CognitiveLoopV2` to match what mind.py expects

3. **Simplified Imports**: Removed the conditional import logic in mind.py - now always uses the memory-enabled cognitive loop

4. **Complete Structure**: The base_code_template now contains:
   - cognitive_loop_v2.py (with memory system integration)
   - memory/ directory with all memory components
   - perception/ directory with environment scanner
   - All other required files (boot_rom.py, brain_protocol.py, etc.)

## Next Steps

The server needs to be restarted to copy the updated base_code_template to Alice's runtime directory. This will provide her with:
- The memory and perception modules she's currently missing
- The corrected cognitive loop that properly integrates with the memory system

## Benefits

- No confusion between multiple cognitive loop versions
- All agents use the same memory-enabled cognitive system
- Cleaner codebase with single implementation
- Agents have full filesystem perception and intelligent memory management
