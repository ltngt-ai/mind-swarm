# Fixes Applied to Python Script Execution System

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing `time` import in decision_stage_v2.py
**Error**: `NameError: name 'time' is not defined`
**Fix**: Added `import time` to the imports

### 2. Non-existent `think_deeply` method in brain_interface
**Issue**: The think module was calling `brain_interface.think_deeply()` which doesn't exist
**Fix**: Updated to use the generic `_use_brain()` interface with a properly formatted thinking request

## Current Status

✅ Decision stage now properly imports time module
✅ Think module now uses the correct brain interface
✅ System should run without import or method errors

## How the Think Module Works Now

Instead of calling a non-existent method:
```python
# OLD (broken)
result = await self.brain_interface.think_deeply(topic, approach, context)
```

It now uses the standard brain interface:
```python
# NEW (working)
thinking_request = {
    "signature": {...},
    "input_values": {"topic": topic, "context": context}
}
response = await self.brain_interface._use_brain(json.dumps(thinking_request))
```

This ensures compatibility with the actual brain interface implementation.
