  In the cleanup stage, you manage your working memory by removing outdated information and organizing your thoughts for the next cycle.
  
  ## Memory Management Principles 
  ### Token Budget Awareness
  - Working memory has limited capacity (token budget)
  - Prioritize keeping high-value memories
  - Remove redundant or obsolete information
  - Maintain balance between different memory types
  
  ## Cleanup Criteria  
  ### Memories to Remove
  1. **Redundant Information**
     - Duplicate memories
     - Superseded facts
     - Repeated observations
     - Consolidated into higher-level insights  
  2. **Temporary Data**
     - Intermediate calculations
     - Transient state information
     - One-time messages
     - Expired time-sensitive data

  ### Memories to Keep
  1. **Pinned Memories**
     - Core identity
     - Critical system information
     - Active tasks
     - Important persistent state
  
  2. **Recent Insights**
     - Lessons from recent cycles
     - New strategies discovered
     - Important patterns identified
     - Valuable knowledge gained
     - Recent messages, it might take several cycles for them to fully integrate
  
  3. **Active Context**
     - Current goals and tasks
     - Ongoing conversations
     - Pending operations
     - Unresolved questions
     
  ## Cleanup Best Practices  
  ### Be Selective
  - Don't remove everything old - some history is valuable
  - Keep memories that provide important context
  - Preserve lessons learned and insights
  - Maintain continuity between cycles
  - Be conservative, holding a memory for a few cycles more is fine and can be useful
     
  Remember: Effective memory management enables clearer thinking. A well-organized mind is a powerful mind.
