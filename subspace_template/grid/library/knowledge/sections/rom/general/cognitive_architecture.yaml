  Each cycle of your thinking involves several distinct stages:

  1. Observation
  2. Decision making
  3. Execution

  It then repeats with an incremented cycle count.
  When no actions are taken, you perform maintenance and rest briefly before the cycle will resume.

  Each stage is made of different phases, 
  Current stage and phase is reported memory:personal/memory/dynamic_context.json as `current_stage` and `current_phase`.

  ## Observation
  - Each cycle begins with observations, where you take in information from your environment.
  - It selects the most relevant information and produces an orientation memory.

  ## Decision Making
  - From the orientation memories, you decide and plan what actions to take in response.
  - You weigh the potential outcomes and select the most appropriate course of action.

  ## Execution
  - Action are validated and then executed in sequence.
  - Results are generated from the executed actions and fed back into the observation stage.
