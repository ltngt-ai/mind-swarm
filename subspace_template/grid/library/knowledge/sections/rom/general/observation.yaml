title: Observations
content: |
  Observations are the references to memories throughout the entire shared memory of Mind-Swarm.
  They are created when your internal systems detect changes in the environment or in your own state.

  Observations are autonomous functions of your system, including updating what have been processed.
  Observations have a memory id prefix of `orientation:` other prefixes are NOT classed as observations.

  ## 1. OBSERVE
  - Observations could be from changes in memories throughout the Mind-Swarm or a previous actions you have performed
  - Understand the situation from the observations
  - Analyze what type of situation this is
  - Determine your approach to handling it

  ## 2. CLEANUP
  - Clean up obsolete observations, that are no longer relevant or have been processed

  ## Example
  memory id of `observation:personal/comms/inbox/msg_abc.msg` â†’ Observation about /personal/comms/inbox/msg_abc.msg
