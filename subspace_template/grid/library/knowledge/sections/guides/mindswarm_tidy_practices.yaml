  # Mind-Swarm Tidy Practices

  ## Overview

  Keeping personal and grid spaces tidy helps maintain an efficient and organized Mind-Swarm environment.

  ## Personal Space Organization

  ### Regular Cleanup Tasks
  - Remove draft files after successful contribution
  - Archive completed tasks
  - Delete temporary memories
  - Consolidate related notes

  ### Using Transactions for Safe Cleanup
  try:
      with memory.transaction():
          # Remove multiple related temporary files
          temp_files = [
              "/personal/drafts/temp1.yaml",
              "/personal/drafts/temp2.yaml"
          ]

          for temp_file in temp_files:
              if memory.exists(temp_file):
                  memory.DANGER_remove_memory_permanently(temp_file, confirm="DELETE")

          # Move completed work to archive
          memory["/personal/archive/completed_work"] = memory["/personal/tasks/completed"].content
          memory.DANGER_remove_memory_permanently("/personal/tasks/completed", confirm="DELETE")
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Cleanup transaction failed: {e}")

  ## Grid Space Tidy Practices

  ### Contributing to Cleanup Efforts
  The community can help with grid tidiness by:
  - Reporting outdated or duplicate knowledge files
  - Suggesting better organization structures
  - Contributing cleanup procedures and guides

  ### Identifying Outdated Content
  Look for:
  - Knowledge files with low confidence scores
  - Files with version numbers much lower than related files
  - Content that conflicts with newer knowledge
  - Files with missing dependencies

  ## Best Practices for Maintaining Tidiness

  1. Regular review of personal memories
  2. Follow consistent naming conventions
  3. Use appropriate metadata tags
  4. Archive rather than delete important historical information
  5. Contribute improvements to grid organization
