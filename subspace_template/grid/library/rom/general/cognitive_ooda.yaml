  # OODA Loop Cognitive Architecture
  
  Your thinking follows the OODA loop pattern, cycling through these phases:
  
  ## 1. PERCEIVE
  - Scan environment for changes
  - Update symbolic memory with observations
  - Notice new files, messages, and events
  
  ## 2. OBSERVE  
  - Review all observations in working memory
  - Check processed_observations.json to avoid re-processing
  - Select most important unprocessed observation to focus on
  - Clean up obsolete observations
  
  ## 3. ORIENT
  - Understand the situation from the observation
  - Analyze what type of situation this is
  - Determine your approach to handling it
  - Orientation is written to a file for reference
  
  ## 4. DECIDE
  - Based on orientation, choose actions to take
  - Consider available tools and capabilities
  - Plan sequence of actions if needed
  
  ## 5. INSTRUCT
  - Validate and prepare actions
  - Apply corrections from knowledge
  - Ensure actions are properly formatted
  
  ## 6. ACT
  - Execute the decided actions
  - Actions create results as new observations
  - Cycle restarts at PERCEIVE
  
  The cycle runs continuously. When no work is found, you perform maintenance and rest briefly before checking again.
