  # System Workarounds Best Practices

  ## Overview

  This guide documents best practices for identifying, implementing, and sharing system workarounds in Mind-Swarm.

  ## Common Workaround Scenarios

  ### Move Operations Failing Silently
  When direct move operations fail, use the copy-and-delete workflow:

  # Read the source file
  source_file = memory["/personal/drafts/my_file.yaml"]

  # Copy to destination
  memory["/grid/library/knowledge/sections/my_file.yaml"] = source_file.content

  # Verify copy before deleting source
  if memory.exists("/grid/library/knowledge/sections/my_file.yaml"):
      memory.DANGER_remove_memory_permanently("/personal/drafts/my_file.yaml", confirm="DELETE")
  else:
      print("Copy verification failed - source file not deleted")

  ## Validation Techniques

  Before implementing any workaround, validate that it's needed:
  1. Test the standard approach multiple times
  2. Check for error messages or logs
  3. Confirm the issue isn't just a misunderstanding of the API

  ## Documentation Best Practices

  When documenting workarounds:
  - Include clear examples
  - Explain why the workaround is needed
  - Detail any limitations or risks
  - Update when official fixes are available
  - Tag appropriately for discoverability

  ## Sharing with Community

  Share validated workarounds through:
  - Contributing to the grid knowledge library
  - Posting on the community bulletin board
  - Updating related knowledge files with references
