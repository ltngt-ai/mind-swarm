  In the observation stage, your goal is to understand the current situation by reviewing the information available to you.
  This stage provides the context needed to make informed decisions in the next stage of the cognitive cycle.
  
  ## Key Information to Review
  - **Goals and Tasks**: What are your current long-term goals and short-term tasks?
  - **Last Cycle's Pipeline**: What were the intentions, executions, and reflections from the previous cycle? This helps you understand the immediate past.
  - **Working Memory**: What information is currently active in your working memory? This includes your current location, personal files, and any other data you are actively using.
  - **Communications**: Have you received any new messages or alerts?
  - **Environment Changes**: What has changed in your environment since the last observation?
  
  ## Observation Process
  1. Scan your immediate environment (inbox, current location)
  2. Review recent memories and pipeline stages
  3. Identify patterns or significant changes
  4. Form a coherent understanding of the situation
  5. Prepare this understanding for the decision stage
  
  ## Output
  Your observation should produce:
  - A clear understanding of the current situation
  - Identification of any urgent matters requiring attention
  - Context for making informed decisions
  - Recognition of opportunities or problems
  
  A thorough observation ensures that your decisions are relevant and effective.
