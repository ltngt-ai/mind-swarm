# Agent Actions and Python Usage Enhancement Ideas

This document outlines ideas for enhancing the Mind-Swarm agent action system and Python integration capabilities.

## Current State

### Existing Actions
- **Base Actions** (all agents):
  - `send_message` - Send messages to other agents
  - `update_memory` - Update agent's memory
  - `wait` - Wait for condition or timeout
  - `finish` - Complete task and exit loop

- **IO Agent Actions**:
  - `make_network_request` - HTTP requests through body file
  - `check_network_response` - Check for responses
  - `process_network_response` - Process HTTP responses
  - `send_user_response` - Send response to user

### Current Limitations
- Actions are quite basic - mainly messaging and simple operations
- No code execution, file manipulation, or complex tool usage
- IO agents have network capabilities but limited other abilities
- No direct Python execution capabilities

## Enhancement Ideas

### 1. Code Execution Action
Allow agents to write and execute Python code in a sandboxed environment.

**Implementation Details:**
- `execute_python` action that runs code in a restricted namespace
- Use `exec()` with careful sandboxing or RestrictedPython library
- Configurable execution limits (time, memory, allowed modules)
- Results stored in memory for future reference
- Error handling and stack trace capture

**Use Cases:**
- Mathematical calculations
- Data processing and transformation
- Algorithm implementation
- Testing hypotheses

### 2. File System Actions
Enable agents to interact with their file system within allowed boundaries.

**Proposed Actions:**
- `read_file` - Read files from allowed directories
  - Parameters: path, encoding, lines_limit
  - Returns: content, metadata (size, modified time)
  
- `write_file` - Write files to agent's workspace
  - Parameters: path, content, mode (overwrite/append)
  - Automatic backup before overwrite
  
- `list_directory` - Explore file structures
  - Parameters: path, pattern, recursive
  - Returns: file list with metadata
  
- `search_files` - grep-like searching
  - Parameters: pattern, path, file_pattern
  - Returns: matches with context

**Security Considerations:**
- Restrict to agent's home directory and shared grid
- Path traversal prevention
- File size limits
- Allowed file type restrictions

### 3. Tool Integration Framework
Create a flexible system for agents to use various tools.

**Core Design:**
- `use_tool` action that can invoke registered tools
- Tools are Python functions/classes registered in the grid
- Tool discovery through the workshop directory
- Tool documentation and capability description

**Example Tools:**
- Calculator (advanced math operations)
- Regex matcher and builder
- JSON/YAML parser and validator
- Markdown renderer
- Data visualization (generate charts)
- Text processing (summarization, extraction)
- Code formatter and linter

### 4. Agent Collaboration Actions
Enhance multi-agent cooperation capabilities.

**Proposed Actions:**
- `delegate_task` - Assign subtasks to other agents
  - Parameters: agent_name, task_description, context
  - Tracks delegation status
  
- `request_capability` - Ask other agents for help
  - Parameters: capability_needed, context
  - Automatic agent discovery based on capabilities
  
- `share_knowledge` - Publish findings to grid library
  - Parameters: knowledge_type, content, tags
  - Automatic formatting to knowledge schema
  
- `form_workgroup` - Create temporary agent teams
  - Parameters: agents, shared_goal, coordination_type

### 5. Learning and Memory Actions
Enable agents to learn from experience and build knowledge.

**Proposed Actions:**
- `create_knowledge_entry` - Convert discoveries into reusable knowledge
  - Automatic knowledge graph building
  - Version control for knowledge updates
  
- `train_on_example` - Learn from successful task completions
  - Store problem-solution pairs
  - Pattern recognition for similar tasks
  
- `reflect_on_task` - Meta-cognitive analysis
  - Analyze what worked/didn't work
  - Update internal strategies
  
- `query_knowledge_graph` - Smart knowledge retrieval
  - Semantic search capabilities
  - Relationship traversal

### 6. Enhanced Decision Making
Improve agent planning and decision capabilities.

**Features:**
- Multi-step planning with `create_plan` and `execute_plan` actions
- Conditional logic in action sequences (if-then-else)
- Parallel action execution for independent tasks
- Rollback capabilities for failed action sequences
- Cost-benefit analysis for action selection

**Implementation:**
- Plan representation as structured data
- Plan validation before execution
- Progress tracking and checkpointing
- Dynamic plan adjustment based on results

### 7. Python Integration Ideas

**Dynamic Module Loading:**
- Agents can load Python modules from the grid
- Version management for modules
- Dependency resolution
- Security sandboxing for loaded code

**Code Generation:**
- Use DSPy to generate Python code for complex tasks
- Code templates for common patterns
- Automatic testing of generated code
- Code explanation generation

**REPL Integration:**
- Give agents access to an IPython-like REPL
- Session management and history
- Variable persistence across REPL calls
- Rich output support (tables, plots)

**Jupyter-style Notebooks:**
- Agents can create/execute notebook cells
- Markdown documentation cells
- Code cell execution with output capture
- Notebook sharing between agents

### 8. Advanced IO Capabilities
Extend IO agent abilities beyond HTTP.

**Additional Protocols:**
- WebSocket support for real-time communication
- File upload/download capabilities
- API integration helpers (OAuth, rate limiting)
- Database query capabilities (read-only initially)

### 9. Monitoring and Debugging Actions
Help agents understand their own behavior.

**Proposed Actions:**
- `profile_performance` - Measure execution times
- `trace_execution` - Detailed execution logging
- `inspect_memory` - Analyze memory usage patterns
- `debug_break` - Pause for external inspection

### 10. User Suggestions
[Space for additional ideas from user feedback]

- **Memory-Centric File Operations**: Files should be treated as memories in the agent worldview. The hive mind's memory IS the filesystem, so file operations should feel like memory operations. Implemented through FocusMemoryAction, CreateMemoryAction, and SearchMemoryAction.

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Foundation)
1. ✅ Code Execution Action (basic Python exec) - COMPLETED
2. ✅ File System Actions (read/write) - COMPLETED as Memory Actions
3. Basic Tool Framework - IN PROGRESS

### Phase 2 (Collaboration)
4. Agent Collaboration Actions
5. Enhanced Decision Making
6. Knowledge Sharing

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
7. Learning/Memory Actions
8. Full Python Integration
9. Advanced IO Capabilities
10. Monitoring/Debugging

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- All actions must respect sandbox boundaries
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Capability-based permissions

### Performance
- Async execution where possible
- Result caching for expensive operations
- Lazy loading of tools and modules
- Efficient memory management

### Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for new actions
- Action composition and chaining
- Custom action development by agents
- Version compatibility management

## Next Steps
1. Review and prioritize ideas
2. Design detailed specifications for Phase 1 actions
3. Implement proof-of-concept for code execution
4. Test security implications
5. Gather feedback from agent behaviors
