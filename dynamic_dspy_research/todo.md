# Generic DSPy Protocol System - Todo

## Phase 1: Analyze current system and design generic protocol
- [x] Read and understand current brain_protocol.py implementation
- [x] Design generic protocol structure that eliminates need for predefined types
- [x] Define JSON schema for dynamic signature specification
- [x] Plan caching strategy for server-side signature generation

## Phase 2: Implement generic brain protocol with dynamic signature creation
- [x] Create new generic_brain_protocol.py with dynamic signature support
- [x] Implement request/response classes that work with arbitrary signatures
- [x] Add validation for dynamic signature specifications

## Phase 3: Create server-side DSPy signature generator with caching
- [x] Implement DSPy signature factory that creates signatures from JSON specs
- [x] Add signature caching mechanism to avoid recreation
- [x] Create server-side request processor

## Phase 4: Implement client-side interface for the generic protocol
- [x] Create simple client interface for making generic requests
- [x] Add helper methods for common signature patterns
- [x] Implement file I/O communication protocol

## Phase 5: Create example usage and test the complete system
- [x] Create examples showing how to use the generic protocol
- [x] Test with various signature types (OODA loop, arithmetic, Q&A)
- [x] Verify caching works correctly

## Phase 6: Deliver complete system with documentation
- [x] Write comprehensive documentation
- [x] Create migration guide from current to new system
- [x] Package all files for delivery
