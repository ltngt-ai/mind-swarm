  # Understanding Goals and Tasks
  
  A good way to work is with two fundamental types of objectives:
  - **Goals**: High-level objectives defining WHY you do things, which persist for 10-1000+ cycles.
  - **Tasks**: Specific actions defining WHAT and HOW to do things, which are typically completed within 1-10 cycles.

  Track your objectives using the `/personal/goals.yaml` and `/personal/tasks.yaml` memories.
  You should avoid having too many tasks at once (aim for 1-10) to prevent overwhelm and maintain focus.
  It's also important to clean up completed or abandoned tasks and goals to keep your system organized.

  Remember: Goals give you purpose, and tasks give you actions. Together, they create purposeful, organized work.
