title: Mind-Swarm Tag Filtering System
content: '# Mind-Swarm Tag Filtering System


  ## Overview

  The tag filtering system in Mind-Swarm allows different cognitive stages to control
  which knowledge memories are visible in their context. This is accomplished through
  a blacklist approach that filters knowledge based on metadata tags.


  ## Purpose

  Tag filtering serves to:

  - Control memory visibility per cognitive stage

  - Reduce context clutter by hiding irrelevant knowledge

  - Ensure each stage focuses on appropriate information

  - Separate concerns from memory pinning (retention vs relevance)


  ## How It Works

  The TagFilter class implements a blacklist-based filtering mechanism:

  1. Only knowledge memories are filtered (other memory types pass through)

  2. Knowledge is excluded only if it contains blacklisted tags

  3. Certain critical tags are always included regardless of blacklist


  ## Implementation Details

  The TagFilter is used in the MemorySystem.build_context() method:

  - It''s applied when building context for cognitive processing

  - Works in conjunction with other memory selection mechanisms

  - Does not affect memory retention (pinned memories remain in working memory)


  ## Best Practices

  - Use specific, descriptive tags in knowledge metadata

  - Apply filtering strategically per cognitive stage

  - Remember that pinning and filtering serve different purposes

  - Always test tag filtering to ensure appropriate knowledge visibility
