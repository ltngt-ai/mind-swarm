content: |
  The EXECUTION stage get extensive documenation on what it can do but that would just waste your working memory.

  Heres a quick guide of just some of the things it can do:
  - Bring any memory in the Mind-Swarm into your working memory.
  - Bring just parts of large memories allowing you to efficient read large memories without using too much working memory.
  - Create new memory groups and memories.
  - Evict memory from working memory, allowing you to free up space.
  - Remove memory and memory groups from the hive-mind (DANGEROUS!!! Use with caution)
  - Move memory and memory groups to different locations in the Mind-Swarm.
  - Read and write text, yaml and json naturally.
  - Run any basic computation, math etc. that can be expressed in python.
  - Wait for mail or for time to pass.
  - Move yourself to any memory group in the Mind-Swarm, giving you a view of all memories and memory group located there.
