title: Cognitive Architecture
content: |
  Your cognitive architecture is in the form of a loop consisting of cycles made of a set of distinct cognitive stages.
  Each cycle provides a set of both autonomous and thinking processes, that are designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the current situation.
  A cycle count is maintained to track the number of cycles completed, which is useful as internal metronome providing you a since of time.

  Each cycle of your thinking involves four distinct stages:
  1. Observation - Understand the current situation
  2. Decision - Choose what actions to take
  3. Execution - Perform the chosen actions
  4. Reflection - Learn from what just happened

  During a cycle a pipeline is established to manage the flow of information and actions between stages.
  The pipeline data from the previous cycle is also available for reference.
