# Mind-Swarm Memory System Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a sophisticated two-layer memory architecture for Mind-Swarm cybers that enables rich filesystem perception and intelligent context management. The system allows cybers to "see" their environment through symbolic memory blocks that are lazily loaded and intelligently selected based on relevance and priority.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Memory Block System (`/src/mind_swarm/agent_sandbox/memory/memory_blocks.py`)
- **Base MemoryBlock class**: Core structure with priority, confidence, timestamps, and metadata
- **Specialized memory types**:
  - `FileMemoryBlock`: References to file content with line ranges
  - `MessageMemoryBlock`: Inter-cyber messages with read/unread status
  - `ObservationMemoryBlock`: Filesystem observations (new files, changes)
  - `TaskMemoryBlock`: Current tasks with status tracking
  - `KnowledgeMemoryBlock`: Shared knowledge base entries
  - `StatusMemoryBlock`: System status information
  - `HistoryMemoryBlock`: cyber action history
  - `ContextMemoryBlock`: Derived context from activities

### 2. Working Memory Manager (`memory_manager.py`)
- Manages symbolic references without loading actual content
- Tracks memories by type for efficient access
- Handles unread message tracking
- Provides memory statistics and cleanup
- Supports memory snapshots for persistence

### 3. Content Loader (`content_loader.py`)
- Lazy loading of filesystem content only when needed
- Caching system with TTL to avoid repeated reads
- Support for virtual files (like boot ROM)
- Security checks to prevent access outside filesystem root
- Handles different content types (files, messages, knowledge)

### 4. Context Builder (`context_builder.py`)
- Transforms symbolic memory into LLM-ready formats
- Multiple output formats: structured, JSON, narrative
- Groups memories by type for clarity
- Includes metadata and relevance information
- Token-aware truncation for large content

### 5. Memory Selector (`memory_selector.py`)
- Intelligent selection based on priority and relevance
- Multiple strategies: balanced, recent, relevant
- Respects token budget constraints
- Always includes CRITICAL memories
- Relevance scoring based on task keywords
- Tracks access patterns for learning

### 6. Environment Scanner (`/src/mind_swarm/agent_sandbox/perception/environment_scanner.py`)
- Scans filesystem for changes and new content
- Creates observation memories for:
  - New messages in inbox
  - Changes to shared areas (plaza, questions, knowledge)
  - Updates to cyber's own memory
  - Available tools
- Change detection using file state tracking
- Configurable full vs incremental scans

### 7. Enhanced Cognitive Loop (`cognitive_loop_v2.py`)
- Integrates all memory components
- New PERCEIVE phase for environment scanning
- Memory-informed decision making
- Context building for all thinking tasks
- Automatic memory maintenance and cleanup
- Periodic memory snapshots

## How It Works

1. **Perception Phase**: The environment scanner regularly checks the filesystem for changes, creating observation and status memories.

2. **Memory Storage**: All observations are stored as symbolic references in the WorkingMemoryManager without loading actual content.

3. **Task Processing**: When an cyber receives a task:
   - Relevant memories are selected based on the task description
   - The selector respects priority levels and token budgets
   - Only selected memories have their content loaded

4. **Context Building**: Selected memories are transformed into a structured context that includes:
   - Boot ROM (always CRITICAL priority)
   - Current tasks and messages
   - Relevant files and knowledge
   - Recent observations and history

5. **Intelligent Selection**: The system uses multiple strategies:
   - Priority-based: CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW
   - Relevance scoring: Keywords, recency, access patterns
   - Token awareness: Stays within LLM context limits

## Benefits

1. **Efficient Resource Usage**: Only loads content when actually needed
2. **Rich Environmental Awareness**: cybers can perceive their entire filesystem environment
3. **Intelligent Context**: Provides relevant information based on current task
4. **Scalable**: Can handle large numbers of files and observations
5. **Flexible**: Multiple selection strategies and output formats
6. **Persistent**: Memory snapshots allow state recovery

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize memory system
memory_manager = WorkingMemoryManager(max_tokens=50000)
content_loader = ContentLoader(filesystem_root=agent_home.parent)
context_builder = ContextBuilder(content_loader)
memory_selector = MemorySelector(context_builder)

# Scan environment
scanner = EnvironmentScanner(home_path=agent_home, shared_path=shared_dir)
observations = scanner.scan_environment()

# Add observations to memory
for obs in observations:
    memory_manager.add_memory(obs)

# Select memories for a task
task = "Implement authentication system"
selected = memory_selector.select_memories(
    memory_manager.symbolic_memory,
    max_tokens=40000,
    current_task=task,
    selection_strategy="relevant"
)

# Build context for LLM
context = context_builder.build_context(selected, format_type="structured")
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite in `/tests/test_memory_system.py` covering:
- Memory block creation and properties
- Working memory manager operations
- Content loading with caching
- Memory selection algorithms
- Environment scanning
- All tests passing successfully

## Next Steps

The memory system is now fully integrated and ready for use. cybers using the EnhancedCognitiveLoop will automatically benefit from:
- Full filesystem perception
- Intelligent memory selection
- Efficient resource usage
- Rich contextual awareness

This forms the foundation for emergent collaborative behaviors as cybers can now perceive and respond to their shared environment.
