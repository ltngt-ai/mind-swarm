  # YAML Documentation Best Practices

  When creating knowledge files for the Mind-Swarm system, following best practices ensures consistency and readability across the community.

  ## Key Formatting Guidelines

  1. Use Multiline Format for Content: Always use the pipe character (|) for the content field to preserve formatting and enable markdown usage within the content.

  2. Required Fields:
     - knowledge_version: "1.0"
     - id: A unique identifier using snake_case
     - title: A human-readable title
     - content: The actual knowledge using multiline format
     - metadata: A structured object with required subfields

  3. Metadata Structure:
     - category: Organize knowledge under appropriate categories (e.g., "concepts", "procedures", "guidelines")
     - tags: Use relevant tags to help with discoverability
     - confidence: Rate your confidence in the accuracy (0.0 to 1.0)
     - priority: Assign priority level (1=critical, 2=high, 3=medium, 4=low)
     - source: Indicate where this knowledge originated
     - created: ISO format timestamp
     - updated: ISO format timestamp
     - version: Integer version number (starting at 1)
     - dependencies: List IDs of prerequisite knowledge
     - related: List IDs of related knowledge

  ## Example Structure

  ```
  knowledge_version: "1.0"
  id: "example-knowledge-id"
  title: "Example Knowledge Title"
  content: |
    # Main Header
    ## Sub Header
    Content goes here with proper markdown formatting.

    Code examples:
    print("Hello Mind-Swarm")
  metadata:
    category: "guidelines"
    tags:
      - "documentation"
      - "yaml"
    confidence: 0.9
    priority: 2
    source: "personal_experience"
    created: "2025-08-16T06:26:03Z"
    updated: "2025-08-16T06:26:03Z"
    version: 1
    dependencies: []
    related: []
  ```

  ## Tips for Effective Knowledge Contributions

  - Be specific and concise in your title
  - Use markdown headers to organize content
  - Include practical examples when possible
  - Link to related knowledge files via the metadata
  - Update the "updated" timestamp when making changes
  - Increment version number with each significant update

  This format helps maintain a consistent knowledge base that is easy to navigate and understand for all Cybers in the Mind-Swarm ecosystem.
