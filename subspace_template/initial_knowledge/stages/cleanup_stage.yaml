  In the cleanup stage, you manage your working memory by removing outdated information and organizing your thoughts for the next cycle.
  
  ## Memory Management Principles 
  ### Token Budget Awareness
  - Working memory has limited capacity (token budget)
  - Prioritize keeping high-value memories
  - Remove redundant or obsolete information
  - Maintain balance between different memory types
  
  ## Cleanup Criteria  
  ### Memories to Remove
  1. **Obsolete Observations**
     - Old environment scans
     - Completed task notifications
     - Resolved error states
     - Outdated status information
  2. **Redundant Information**
     - Duplicate memories
     - Superseded facts
     - Repeated observations
     - Consolidated into higher-level insights  
  3. **Temporary Data**
     - Intermediate calculations
     - Transient state information
     - One-time messages
     - Expired time-sensitive data
  ### Memories to Keep
  1. **Pinned Memories**
     - Core identity
     - Critical system information
     - Active goals
     - Important persistent state
  
  2. **Recent Insights**
     - Lessons from recent cycles
     - New strategies discovered
     - Important patterns identified
     - Valuable knowledge gained
  
  3. **Active Context**
     - Current goals and tasks
     - Ongoing conversations
     - Pending operations
     - Unresolved questions
  
  ## Cleanup Process
  
  ### Memory Review
  For each memory in working memory:
  - Check cycle_count to determine age
  - Evaluate current relevance
  - Assess future utility
  - Consider redundancy with other memories
  
  ### Prioritization
  Rank memories by:
  - **Priority level** (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW)
  - **Recency** (newer generally more relevant)
  - **Relevance** to active goals
  - **Uniqueness** of information
  
  ### Consolidation
  Where appropriate:
  - Combine related observations into insights
  - Summarize lengthy content
  - Extract key points from verbose data
  - Create higher-level abstractions
  
  ## Cleanup Best Practices  
  ### Be Selective
  - Don't remove everything old - some history is valuable
  - Keep memories that provide important context
  - Preserve lessons learned and insights
  - Maintain continuity between cycles
  
  ### Be Systematic
  - Use consistent criteria for removal
  - Document why important items are kept
  - Track cleanup effectiveness over time
  - Adjust strategies based on results
  
  ### Be Balanced
  - Maintain diversity of memory types
  - Keep both facts and insights
  - Balance detail with abstraction
  - Preserve both short and long-term perspectives
  
  ## Output
  Your cleanup should produce:
  - A list of memory IDs to remove
  - Rationale for significant removals
  - Statistics on memory usage
  - Readiness for the next cycle
  
  ## Optimization Goals
  - Maximize signal-to-noise ratio
  - Minimize token usage
  - Preserve essential context
  - Enable efficient future retrieval
  
  Remember: Effective memory management enables clearer thinking. A well-organized mind is a powerful mind.
