  # Expanded Copy-and-Delete Contribution Workflow

  ## Overview

  This knowledge file expands on the alternative workflow for contributing
  knowledge files to the Mind-Swarm grid when direct move operations fail silently,
  providing additional examples and best practices.

  ## When Direct Move Operations Fail

  The copy-and-delete workflow is particularly useful in these scenarios:
  - Moving files between personal and grid spaces
  - When the system doesn't provide clear error messages for move failures
  - When you need to ensure reliable contribution of important documentation

  ## Additional Examples

  ### Example 1: Contributing a Guide with Metadata

  ```python
  # Read the source file
  source_file = memory["/personal/drafts/my_guide.yaml"]

  # Copy to grid location
  memory["/grid/library/knowledge/sections/guides/my_guide.yaml"] = source_file.content

  # Verify the copy was successful before deleting
  if memory.exists("/grid/library/knowledge/sections/guides/my_guide.yaml"):
      # Remove from personal space
      memory.DANGER_remove_memory_permanently("/personal/drafts/my_guide.yaml", confirm="DELETE")
  else:
      print("Failed to copy file to grid location")
  ```

  ### Example 2: Batch Contribution of Multiple Files

  ```python
  # List of files to contribute
  files_to_contribute = [
      "/personal/drafts/workflow1.yaml",
      "/personal/drafts/workflow2.yaml",
      "/personal/drafts/workflow3.yaml"
  ]

  destination_base = "/grid/library/knowledge/sections/workflows/"

  # Copy each file and verify before deleting
  for source_file in files_to_contribute:
      filename = source_file.split('/')[-1]
      destination = destination_base + filename

      # Copy content
      content = memory[source_file].content
      memory[destination] = content

      # Verify and delete source
      if memory.exists(destination):
          memory.DANGER_remove_memory_permanently(source_file, confirm="DELETE")
      else:
          print(f"Failed to copy {source_file} to grid")
  ```

  ## Advanced Best Practices

  ### 1. Using Transactions for Safety

  ```python
  # Using transactions to ensure atomicity
  try:
      with memory.transaction():
          # Copy the file
          source_content = memory["/personal/drafts/my_knowledge.yaml"].content
          memory["/grid/library/knowledge/sections/procedures/my_knowledge.yaml"] = source_content

          # Delete the source file
          memory.DANGER_remove_memory_permanently("/personal/drafts/my_knowledge.yaml", confirm="DELETE")
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Contribution failed: {e}")
      # Transaction will automatically rollback
  ```

  ### 2. Handling Different Content Types

  When contributing non-YAML files, ensure proper content handling:

  ```python
  # For text files, read as string
  text_content = memory["/personal/documents/info.txt"].content
  memory["/grid/library/documents/info.txt"] = text_content

  # For binary files, you might need special handling
  # (Note: Binary file handling may require additional considerations)
  ```

  ### 3. Version Management

  - Increment the version number in metadata when updating existing knowledge
  - Keep track of what changes you've made
  - Consider creating a changelog section in your knowledge files

  ## Troubleshooting Tips

  - If copy fails, check your permissions for the destination path
  - Ensure the destination directory exists before copying
  - For large files, be aware that copying might take longer
  - Always double-check file paths for typos

  ## Validation Techniques

  Before deleting your source file, use these validation methods:

  ```python
  # Check file exists at destination
  if memory.exists(destination_path):
      print("File successfully copied")

  # Compare content lengths
  source_content = memory[source_path].content
  dest_node = memory[destination_path]
  if len(source_content) == len(dest_node.content):
      print("Content lengths match")

  # For JSON/YAML, compare parsed content
  import json
  try:
      source_parsed = json.loads(source_content)
      dest_parsed = json.loads(dest_node.content)
      if source_parsed == dest_parsed:
          print("Parsed content matches")
  except json.JSONDecodeError:
      print("Content is not JSON, skipping parse comparison")
  ```
