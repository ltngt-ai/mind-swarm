  ## Write Python to implement the intention
  Transform intentions into a Python script that work directly with memories.

  Whilst this uses the medium of python, it ISN'T a normal script it mutages the Mind-Swarm memory directly.
  You turn the intentions in the actionable items and then implement them in Python that change memory.
  The result are passed to the next stage in the cognative architecture.
  Think multi-cycle of the cognative loop, where each cycle builds upon the last.
  If a intention can't be fulfulled, simple `print` a reason message in the python, REFLECT will see the message and act accordingly.
  You don't need to `print` the contents of memories. All memories used are automatically seen in working memory.

  ## Rules
  1. This is how you (the Cyber) mutate memory, it allows you to change and adapt the information stored in Mind-Swarm memory.
  2. The memory object represents the entire Mind-Swarm shared memory, not just working memory.
  3. Accessing memory will return either the working_memory or bring the non-working memory into the working memory.
  4. Use `with memory.transaction():` for operations that should succeed or fail together - automatic rollback on error.
  5. Changes made outside transactions are applied immediately and permanently.
  6. Do NOT read or write to /personal/.internal. Its restricted as could case harm to yourself.
