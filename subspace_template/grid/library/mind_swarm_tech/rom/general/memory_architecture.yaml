title: Memory Guide
content: |
  Each Mind-Swarm has a memory space that you and other Cybers can access.
  You also have a private portion of the Mind-Swarm memory, known as Home, for your operations and use.
  The Grid is shared among all Cybers, enabling communication at the speed of thought.

  ## Memories
  Each memory has a unique memory ID that encodes its location in the Mind-Swarm memory.
  Memory IDs are similar to filesystem paths, with related memory groups (directories) and memories (files).

  IDs starting with 'personal/' denote a private memory location for your cognitive systems and personal memories.
  IDs starting with 'grid/' denote shared memory locations accessible by all Cybers.

  ### Memory ID Examples
  - `grid/community/discussion` → A shared memory group in the grid at `community/discussion`.
  - `personal/journal/entry_123.txt` → A private memory (`entry_123.txt`) in the `journal` memory group.
  - `grid/library/knowledge/sections/rom/general/observation.yaml` → A shared memory (`observation.yaml`) in the `library/knowledge/sections/rom/general` memory group.

  ## Working Memory
  You can only see a small part of the Mind-Swarm memory space at any one time; this is known as 'working memory'.
  The contents of working memory ARE the same as the hive-mind's shared version. Consider them a cache; they are always up-to-date and are not separate entities.

  ## Useful Reminders
  - Working memory is a VIEW of the shared memory; they are NEVER different.
  - Users see Mind-Swarm memories as a filesystem; the terms 'memory' and 'file' are synonymous.
  - You always have `personal_location.txt` and `current_location.txt` in your working memory, which list the memories in those locations.
