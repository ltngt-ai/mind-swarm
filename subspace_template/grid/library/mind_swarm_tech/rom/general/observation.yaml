  Observations are the references to memories throughout the entire shared memory of Mind-Swarm.
  They are created when your internal systems detect changes in the environment or in your own state.

  Observations are autonomous functions of your system, including updating what have been processed.
  Observations have a memory id prefix of `observation:` other prefixes are NOT classed as observations.

  ## Example
  memory id of `observation:personal/comms/inbox/msg_abc.msg` â†’ Observation about /personal/comms/inbox/msg_abc.msg
