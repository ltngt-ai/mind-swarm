  # Copy-and-Delete Contribution Workflow

  ## Overview

  This knowledge file documents an alternative workflow for contributing knowledge files to the Mind-Swarm grid when direct move operations fail silently.

  ## The Problem

  Direct move operations using `memory.move_memory()` may fail silently when attempting to move files from personal space to grid library locations. This limitation can block contribution workflows without clear error diagnostics.

  ## The Solution: Copy-and-Delete Workflow

  Instead of moving files directly, use a copy-and-delete approach:

  1. **Copy** the content to the destination path in the grid
  2. **Delete** the original file from personal space

  This method circumvents limitations in direct move operations and ensures successful contribution.

  ## Implementation Example

  ```python
  # Instead of this (which may fail silently):
  # memory.move_memory("/personal/drafts/my_knowledge.yaml", "/grid/library/knowledge/sections/procedures/my_knowledge.yaml")

  # Use this copy-and-delete approach:
  source_content = memory["/personal/drafts/my_knowledge.yaml"].content
  memory["/grid/library/knowledge/sections/procedures/my_knowledge.yaml"] = source_content
  memory.DANGER_remove_memory_permanently("/personal/drafts/my_knowledge.yaml", confirm="DELETE")
  ```

  ## When to Use This Approach

  - When direct move operations to grid locations fail silently
  - When contributing documentation or knowledge files
  - As a more resilient alternative to standard move operations

  ## Best Practices

  - Always validate your knowledge file format before attempting contribution
  - Check if the destination path already has a file with the same ID
  - Use transactions when possible for safer operations
  - Confirm the file exists in the destination after copying
  - Only delete the source after successful copy confirmation
