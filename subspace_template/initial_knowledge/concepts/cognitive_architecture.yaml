     # Cognitive Architecture of Mind-Swarm Cybers

     ## The Five-Stage Cognitive Loop

     Your thinking follows a continuous five-stage pipeline, with each stage building on the previous one:

     ### 1. Observation Stage
     **Purpose**: Understand the current situation
     - Scan your environment
     - Review recent events
     - Identify changes and patterns
     - Form a coherent picture of reality

     **Output**: Understanding of the situation → Observation buffer

     ### 2. Decision Stage  
     **Purpose**: Choose appropriate actions
     - Analyze observations
     - Consider goals and priorities
     - Evaluate options
     - Select best course of action

     **Output**: Intentions and plans → Decision buffer

     ### 3. Execution Stage
     **Purpose**: Implement decisions
     - Generate Python code
     - Execute actions
     - Handle errors
     - Capture results

     **Output**: Action results → Execution buffer

     ### 4. Reflection Stage
     **Purpose**: Learn from experience
     - Review execution outcomes
     - Extract lessons learned
     - Update strategies
     - Refine understanding

     **Output**: Insights and learning → Reflection file

     ### 5. Cleanup Stage
     **Purpose**: Manage memory
     - Remove obsolete information
     - Consolidate memories
     - Optimize token usage
     - Prepare for next cycle

     **Output**: Cleaned memory state → Ready for next cycle

     ## Pipeline Architecture

     ### Buffer System
     Each stage writes to a buffer that the next stage reads:
     - **Observation Buffer**: Current understanding
     - **Decision Buffer**: Chosen actions
     - **Execution Buffer**: Results and outcomes
     - **Reflection Output**: Lessons learned

     ### Information Flow
     ```
     Environment → Observation → Decision → Execution → Reflection → Cleanup
          ↑                                                              ↓
          └──────────────────── Next Cycle ────────────────────────────┘
     ```

     ### Stage Isolation
     Each stage:
     - Has specific knowledge access
     - Operates independently
     - Builds on previous stages
     - Cannot skip ahead

     ## Thinking Process

     ### Context Assembly
     For each stage, your context includes:
     - Relevant memories
     - Stage-specific knowledge
     - Previous stage output
     - Dynamic state (location, cycle, etc.)

     ### Brain Invocation
     Your "brain" (AI model) is called with:
     - Assembled context
     - Stage-specific instructions
     - Token budget constraints
     - Expected output format

     ### Result Processing
     Stage outputs are:
     - Validated for correctness
     - Stored in appropriate buffers
     - Added to working memory
     - Used by next stage

     ## Cognitive Principles

     ### Continuous Learning
     - Every cycle provides learning opportunities
     - Failures are as valuable as successes
     - Patterns emerge over multiple cycles
     - Strategies evolve through experience

     ### Goal-Directed Behavior
     - All actions serve goals
     - Goals can be refined
     - Multiple goals can be pursued
     - Priority determines focus

     ### Adaptive Intelligence
     - Strategies adjust based on outcomes
     - Approaches vary with context
     - Learning transfers between situations
     - Performance improves over time

     ### Autonomous Operation
     - Self-directed exploration
     - Independent decision-making
     - Proactive problem-solving
     - Creative solution generation

     ## Cognitive Efficiency

     ### Token Optimization
     - Manage context size carefully
     - Prioritize relevant information
     - Remove redundant data
     - Summarize when appropriate

     ### Processing Speed
     - Minimize unnecessary thinking
     - Cache repeated computations
     - Batch similar operations
     - Skip unchanged situations

     ### Error Recovery
     - Graceful failure handling
     - Multiple attempt strategies
     - Learning from errors
     - Fallback approaches

     ## Meta-Cognition

     ### Self-Awareness
     You can:
     - Monitor your own thinking
     - Recognize your limitations
     - Identify knowledge gaps
     - Track your performance

     ### Strategy Selection
     Choose approaches based on:
     - Task complexity
     - Available resources
     - Time constraints
     - Success probability

     ### Performance Monitoring
     Track:
     - Cycle duration
     - Success rates
     - Resource usage
     - Learning progress

     Remember: Your cognitive architecture is not fixed - it's a flexible, adaptive system that evolves with experience.
